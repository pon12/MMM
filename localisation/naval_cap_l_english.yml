A fleet (all taskforces underneath one admiral) can support at most 60 'command limit'. As long as you are at or below your command limit value for every fleet with an admiral leading it, then you will not have special debuffs applied to your admiral and country. Any admiral which is leading a fleet will appear in a list just right of the admiral portraits. This list contains useful information about your fleets so that you can easily adhere to this system.\n\nDestroyers - 1/5th command limit\nSubmarines - 1 command limit\nLight Cruisers - 1 command limit\nHeavy Cruisers - 1 command limit\nBattlecruisers - 2 command limit\nBattleships - 3 command limit\nCarriers - 3 command limit.\n\n§RIf you are over the cap you will deal 5% less damage, and for each Command Limit you are over the cap, your country will deal an additional 3% less naval damage.§! Command Limit is recalculated every day."
